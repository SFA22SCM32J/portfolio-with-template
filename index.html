                  <h4> I Love Building Creative Solutions that make a meaningful and lasting impact </h4>
                  <p>
                    Driven by a passion for innovation since my childhood, 
                    I thrive on developing cutting-edge solutions to only solve complex problems 
                    but also make it significantly different from others. 
                    Every project I worked on gave me an opportunity to push the 
                    boundaries of what's possible, add creativity with technology
                    to deliver results that are not just effective
                    but also transformative.
                    This dedication to making a meaningful and lasting impact fuels 
                    my commitment to excellence and inspires me to continuously learn 
                    and improve technically.</p>
                   <p> During my leisure time I love to hike, play outdoor, listen to pop music and explore several different cuisines.
